ðŸš¨ Building a Basic Incident Response Plan ðŸš¨

In todayâ€™s digital-first world, cybersecurity incidents are not a question of if but when. A well-defined Incident Response Plan (IRP) ensures your organization can act swiftly to minimize damage, recover operations, and maintain trust.

An effective IRP includes preparation, identifying threats, containing the impact, eliminating the cause, and restoring systems. Equally important is the final step: analyzing the incident and improving future defenses.
Without a plan, incidents can spiral into costly downtime, data loss, and reputational harm. A proactive approach empowers your team to respond with confidence and efficiency.
