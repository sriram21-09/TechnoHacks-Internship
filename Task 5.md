🚨 Understanding Phishing Tactics: A Cybersecurity Simulation 🚨

To better understand how attackers exploit human behavior, I recently created a simulated phishing email. This exercise helped me explore common phishing tactics, such as:

✅ Creating urgency

✅ Spoofing email addresses

✅ Mimicking trusted organizations

🔍 By analyzing these methods, I aim to strengthen awareness and contribute to building safer online practices.

💡 Disclaimer: This was purely an educational exercise and conducted in a controlled environment. The intention is to promote awareness and NOT to engage in malicious activities.
